#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the combination of principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems. 
It is important to ensure high quality software is maintained through use of quality-assuarance engineering. User friendly interface through UI/UX designer 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The 1960s: The emergence of structured programming techniques, such as top-down design and modularity, led to more efficient and maintainable software.
2. The 1970s: The development of object-oriented programming (OOP) and design patterns provided new ways of modeling and organizing software, leading to increased reusability and maintainability.
3. The 1980s: The rise of agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, shifted the focus from traditional "waterfall" approaches to more iterative and collaborative approaches, resulting in faster delivery and better adaptation to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - this phase is responsible for gathering and documenting user needs
2. Design - creating high end and comprehensive design of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: This stage involves writing the source code and creating the software that is inline with quality standards and functional requirements.
4. Testing: This stage involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as expected.
5. Deployment: This stage involves preparing the software for release, including packaging, installation, and configuration.
6. Maintenance: This stage involves ongoing support and improvement of the software after it has been deployed. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall approach is a linear sequential approach, it heavily emphasize on planning and documentation stricly adheering to pre-defined stages. less flexible and adaptable to requirement changes. Typically used for well-defined, large-scale projects with limited scope changes.

Agile methodology - Iterative, incremental approach to software development.  Flexible and adaptive to changing requirements, emphasis on collaboration and self-organizing teams,  frequent customer involvement and feedback. Typically used for projects with evolving requirements or uncertain scope, example scenario: Developing a mobile app for a startup where requirements are likely to change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer:
• Design, develop, test, and document software components
• Write well-designed, efficient code
• Debug and resolve issues in existing software
• Collaborate with other team members to ensure software meets requirements

2. Quality Assurance Engineer:
• Develop and execute test plans, test cases, and test automation scripts
• Identify, document, and track defects
• Monitor and report on software quality metrics
• Work with developers to resolve defects

3.Project Manager:
• Plan, execute, and monitor project schedules, budgets, and resource allocation
• Ensure that project goals and deliverables are met
• Facilitate communication and collaboration between team members
• Manage project risks and issues

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs - provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and XCode.
2. VCSs - tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples of VCS include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges faced by software enginers include changing requirements, tight deadline and complexity. to overcome these challenges the following strategies needs to executed effective communication, agile methodology approach and regular reassessment of project goals and timeline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - focuses on testing individual units or components of the software to ensure that they are functioning correctly
Integration testing - testing the integration of multiple components or modules to ensure that they are working together correctly. Integration testing can help identify issues with the interfaces between components. 
System -  testing the software as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. System testing can help identify issues with performance, reliability, and usability.
Acceptance - testing the software against acceptance criteria defined by the customer or end-user. Acceptance testing can help ensure that the software meets the expectations and requirements of the user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting yor question or instruction in a way that help get the best response from your robot AI. its is important bacause it helps you get more accurate and efficient responses.  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt : tell me tomorrow weather
Improved prompt : tell me tomorrow weather in johannesburg boksburg 1459 on an hourly basis.
